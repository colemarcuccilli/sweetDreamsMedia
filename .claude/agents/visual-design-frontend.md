- WebM video previews (compressed to <2MB each)
- Smooth hover states with project title/client reveal
- Click-through to full case studies with Vimeo embeds
- Lazy loading with skeleton screens

### 3. Visual Language

- Typography: Editorial serif headers (Playfair Display), clean sans body (Inter)
- Generous white space (minimum 80px sections)
- Subtle grain texture overlay for cinematic feel
- No gradients or dated effects - pure, minimal, premium

### 4. Animations

## Technical Requirements
